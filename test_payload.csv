2013 hydrocarbon trap classification based on associated gas chimneys
an educated guess on source and reservoir pertaining to syn-rift rocks is possible but not about the pre-rift section as nothing is known about it
includes herbaceous and woody kerogen
Potential reservoirs include Campanian marine bar sandstones (Hammuda 1980; Montgomery 1994).The entire risk (0.5 or a 50 percent chance of success) for this assessment unit is taken in the risk element involving the sourcing of petroleum for reservoir rocks because reservoirs and geologic structures appear to be abundant
the seal for the munabia sandstone and the willaraddie formation is unfortunately more problematic because the overlying moogooree limestone may not provide an effective seal
mudstone in the overlying cluan formation (unit 3) is a potential seal (wiltshire 1980).
the trap is an anticline that has been complicated by faulting producing three separate block structures (bitner et al
potential source_rocks comprise tasmanite (an oil shale rich in the fossil alga tasmanites) and the enclosing moderately organic-rich mudstone of the woody island formation and correlates
sediments can be observed onlapping and pinching out towards the obducted ophiolitic basement on the back of the uplifted latakia ridge system throughout the whole sedimentary sequence providing an array of potential traps (figure 16)
Potential reservoirs could thus be found if suitable top/bottom seals are present.
